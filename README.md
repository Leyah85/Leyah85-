I study technical writing and my program does not educate in Github. It seems that GitHub is a very sought after skill so I will educate myself!

I am out and about with my fluffy companion every day. Live close to the ocean with loads of rabbit-trails for her to sniff!

My creative skillset includes to paint, to draw, to crochet, to sing and to dance. Write, yes, of course that too! Always loved to communicate in many ways.
